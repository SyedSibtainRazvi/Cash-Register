***
**Brief:** In this application, I have took data from input boxes and using **querySelectors** I have stored them. I have used a **Button** and added event listeners
on **click** function. And used an **errorHandler** incase user inputs negative value. All the computations are done once the event calls the function.

#### What Next?
The next input options are available only when first one is filled.

#### How to contribute?

_I love building things, it does not matter whether the application is small or huge. So if you are new to this technology and eager to learn, we can go ahead and develop more features in the application._
